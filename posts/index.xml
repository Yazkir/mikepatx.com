      <description>Introductions, I guess? You may have read the about section, but just in case (and to be polite), I&amp;rsquo;m mikepatx. I work in the offensive security space and I enjoy learning. I&amp;rsquo;ve done blogs probably a bunch of times over the years but always get lost in the sauce and struggle to keep the ball rolling. Typically one of the issues that I have is that I only try to focus on specific niches in my posts.</description>
